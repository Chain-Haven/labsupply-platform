## Why Start a Research Peptide Brand?

The research peptide market is growing rapidly as academic institutions, biotech companies, and independent laboratories expand their investigational programs. For entrepreneurs, this creates an opportunity to build a brand that serves this demand — without the enormous capital requirements of manufacturing.

White-label fulfillment eliminates the two biggest barriers to entry:

- **Manufacturing complexity** — cGMP synthesis, purification, and testing require specialized facilities and expertise
- **Inventory risk** — Holding stock of dozens of compounds ties up capital and introduces expiration concerns

With a dropship/fulfillment model, you focus on what matters: building your brand, attracting customers, and growing your business.

## Step 1: Define Your Niche

Not every peptide brand needs to carry every compound. Consider focusing on a specific research segment:

- **Tissue repair and regeneration** — BPC-157, TB-500, and related peptides
- **Metabolic research** — Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, AOD-9604
- **Neuropeptide research** — Selank, Semax, DSIP, NAD+
- **Longevity and aging** — Epitalon, GHK-Cu, MOTS-c
- **Full catalog** — Broad selection for general research supply

A focused catalog lets you build deeper expertise and more targeted marketing. You can always expand later.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Legal Entity

Before selling research compounds, establish a proper business structure:

1. **Form an LLC or corporation** — Protect personal assets with a business entity
2. **Obtain an EIN** — Required for business banking and tax filing
3. **Open a business bank account** — Keep business and personal finances separate
4. **Review state and local regulations** — Research chemical distribution requirements vary by jurisdiction
5. **Ensure RUO compliance** — All marketing and labeling must clearly state "For Research Use Only"

> We recommend [Mercury](https://mercury.com) for business banking — their free checking accounts and fast ACH transfers integrate seamlessly with our invoicing system.

## Step 3: Build Your Online Store

Your website is your storefront. Key requirements:

- **Professional design** — Clean, modern, and trustworthy appearance
- **Product pages** — Clear descriptions, pricing, and COA access
- **Compliant copy** — All content must use research-use-only language; avoid health claims
- **Checkout flow** — Smooth purchasing experience with multiple payment options
- **Age verification** — Implement age gates where required by jurisdiction

**WooCommerce on WordPress** is our recommended platform. Our fulfillment plugin integrates directly — automating product import, order sync, and tracking updates.

## Step 4: Select Your Products and Pricing

Once your store is built, connect it to your WhiteLabel Peptides merchant account:

1. Browse the full catalog from your merchant dashboard
2. Select which products to offer on your store
3. Set your own retail prices (our wholesale prices give you healthy margins)
4. Import selected products directly to WooCommerce with one click

**Example margin calculation:**

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Wholesale cost | $15.00 |
| Your retail price | $45.00 |
| **Your profit** | **$30.00 per order** |

Margins vary by product. Popular peptides like BPC-157 and Semaglutide typically support 2-3x markup.

## Step 5: Configure Your Branding

White-label means your customers see your brand, not ours. Available branding options:

- **Custom labels** — Your logo and design on every product
- **Branded packaging** — Custom shipping boxes and packing materials
- **Personalized inserts** — Thank-you cards, instructions, and promotional materials
- **COAs under your brand** — Documentation with your company header

Upload your artwork through the merchant dashboard. Our team reviews for compliance and applies it to your orders.

## Step 6: Fund Your Wallet and Go Live

Our billing model is simple — prepay your wallet, and orders auto-debit as they ship:

1. Fund your wallet via ACH bank transfer
2. Set auto-replenishment thresholds to avoid running dry
3. Publish your products on your store
4. Start driving traffic and taking orders

When a customer purchases from your store, our WooCommerce plugin automatically sends the order to our fulfillment center. We pick, pack with your branding, and ship directly to your customer. Tracking numbers sync back to your store automatically.

## Step 7: Market and Grow

With fulfillment handled, invest your time in growth:

- **Content marketing** — Educational blog posts about research applications (always RUO-compliant)
- **SEO** — Target keywords like "research peptides," "BPC-157 for sale," and related terms
- **Email marketing** — Build a customer list and send new product announcements
- **Social media** — Share educational content (never health claims)
- **Paid advertising** — Google Ads and social media ads (review platform policies for research chemicals)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Making health claims** — Never suggest peptides treat, cure, or prevent any condition
- **Skipping compliance** — RUO labeling and disclaimers are legally required
- **Underpricing** — Don't race to the bottom; compete on quality, trust, and service
- **Ignoring COAs** — Always provide COA documentation; it's your strongest trust signal
- **Neglecting branding** — Generic packaging erodes customer loyalty
