## What Is a Certificate of Analysis?

A Certificate of Analysis (COA) is a formal document issued by a quality-control laboratory that certifies a product has been tested and meets specified quality standards. For research peptides, the COA provides analytical proof that the compound is what it claims to be, at the purity level stated.

COAs are not optional documentation — they are the foundation of credibility in the research supply chain. Institutional buyers, university procurement departments, and serious independent researchers will not purchase peptides without accompanying COA documentation.

## The 6-Panel Testing Protocol

A comprehensive COA for research peptides should include results from six core analytical panels:

### 1. Qualitative Identification (UV-Vis / Lambda Max)

This test confirms the identity of the compound by measuring its ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum. Each peptide has a characteristic absorption profile — the **lambda max** (wavelength of maximum absorption) serves as a fingerprint to verify the compound matches the expected identity.

### 2. Purity Analysis (HPLC)

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is the gold standard for peptide purity determination. The peptide sample is dissolved and passed through a chromatography column that separates it by molecular characteristics. The resulting chromatogram shows the main peptide peak alongside any impurity peaks.

Research-grade peptides should show **≥98% purity by HPLC**. The COA should include the chromatogram or at minimum the calculated purity percentage.

### 3. Quantitative Assay (Beer-Lambert Method)

This test determines the actual peptide content (net peptide weight) in the product. Using the Beer-Lambert law, the concentration of peptide in solution is calculated from its absorbance. This confirms the labeled amount matches the actual content.

> The Beer-Lambert law states that absorbance is directly proportional to concentration and path length: **A = εlc**

### 4. Heavy Metals Testing (ICP-MS)

Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) screens for heavy metal contamination — including lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium. The acceptable threshold is typically **fewer than 20 parts per billion (ppb)** for each element.

Heavy metal contamination can originate from raw materials, manufacturing equipment, or storage containers. This test is essential for ensuring the safety of the compound for laboratory use.

### 5. Total Aerobic Microbial Count (TAMC)

TAMC testing measures the total number of aerobic (oxygen-requiring) microorganisms present in the sample. Results are expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) per gram. Acceptable limits for research peptides are typically **fewer than 100 CFU/g**.

### 6. Total Yeast and Mold Count (TYMC)

Similar to TAMC, this panel specifically measures fungal contamination — yeasts and molds. Acceptable limits are typically **fewer than 10 CFU/g**. Elevated TYMC levels suggest improper manufacturing conditions or inadequate storage.

## How to Read a COA

When reviewing a COA, check for these key elements:

- **Product identification** — Compound name, catalog/lot number, and batch date
- **Test methods** — Specific analytical methods used for each panel
- **Results vs. specifications** — Actual measured values compared against acceptance criteria
- **Pass/fail status** — Clear indication of whether each test was passed
- **Lab identification** — Name and accreditation of the testing laboratory
- **Analyst signature and date** — Formal sign-off with date of analysis

## Why COAs Matter for Your Brand

If you're building a white-label peptide brand, COAs serve multiple purposes:

- **Customer trust** — Sharing COAs demonstrates transparency and commitment to quality
- **Regulatory protection** — Documentation proves due diligence in sourcing
- **Competitive differentiation** — Many suppliers provide minimal or no COA documentation
- **Institutional sales** — Universities and research institutions require COAs for procurement

## Our COA Standards

Every product in the WhiteLabel Peptides catalog includes a comprehensive 6-panel COA. Products are manufactured in **cGMP-aligned facilities** and tested to **cGLP standards** by accredited third-party laboratories. COAs are available for every SKU and can be shared directly with your customers.
