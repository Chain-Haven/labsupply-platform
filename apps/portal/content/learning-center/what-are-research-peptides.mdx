## What Is a Peptide?

Peptides are short chains of amino acids — typically between 2 and 50 residues — linked by peptide bonds. They are smaller than proteins but share similar building blocks. In research contexts, peptides are synthesized to study biological processes, develop new therapeutics, and explore cellular signaling pathways.

## Research-Grade vs. Pharmaceutical-Grade

Not all peptides are created equal. The distinction between research-grade and pharmaceutical-grade compounds is important:

- **Research-grade peptides** are manufactured for laboratory investigation. They undergo rigorous purity testing (typically ≥98% via HPLC) and are accompanied by Certificates of Analysis (COAs). They are labeled "For Research Use Only" (RUO).
- **Pharmaceutical-grade peptides** are manufactured under stricter FDA regulations intended for human clinical use, requiring additional GMP compliance and clinical trial validation.

Research-grade peptides are the standard for academic institutions, independent laboratories, and biotech companies conducting preclinical studies.

## How Are Research Peptides Manufactured?

Modern research peptides are produced through **solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)**, a method developed by Nobel laureate Bruce Merrifield. The process involves:

1. **Resin attachment** — The first amino acid is anchored to an insoluble resin bead.
2. **Sequential coupling** — Amino acids are added one at a time in the correct sequence, each protected by temporary chemical groups to prevent unwanted reactions.
3. **Deprotection and cleavage** — Once the full chain is assembled, protecting groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin.
4. **Purification** — The crude peptide is purified using reverse-phase HPLC to achieve the target purity.
5. **Lyophilization** — The purified peptide is freeze-dried into a stable powder for long-term storage.

## Why Purity Matters

Peptide purity directly impacts research reproducibility. Impurities — including truncated sequences, deletion peptides, and residual solvents — can introduce confounding variables into experimental results.

A minimum purity of **≥98% as determined by HPLC** is the standard benchmark for research-grade peptides. Reputable suppliers provide comprehensive COA documentation for every batch.

## What to Look for in a Peptide Supplier

When evaluating suppliers for your research needs, prioritize:

- **Third-party testing** — Independent analytical verification, not just in-house claims
- **Comprehensive COAs** — Multi-panel testing including HPLC purity, mass spectrometry, endotoxin, and microbial limits
- **cGMP manufacturing** — Facilities that follow Current Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines
- **Proper storage and handling** — Temperature-controlled warehousing and cold-chain shipping when required
- **RUO compliance** — Proper labeling and documentation for research-use-only distribution
